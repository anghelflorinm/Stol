# Stol (Universal Online Storage Tool)

Stol  is an Universal Online Storage Tool written in Vanilla Node.js (for backend), HTML\CSS (for frontend)  and MongoDB (for databases) that integrates the three biggest storage tools APIs (Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox) in a single application. When a user uploads a large file, it is split into multiple parts and uploaded to each of the storage tools linked to the account. The when downloading the uploaded file, the app assures safe file recomposition.
