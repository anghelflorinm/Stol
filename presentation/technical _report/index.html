        <p>
            Stol is an universal online storage tool that enables the user to upload large files, combining the power of the three most famous cloud storage tools: Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox, thus unifiying the three services under a single one.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            These days, there been an increased popularity regarding storing your files online. We move at such a quick pace that having files stored in cloud makes all of our content readily available, no matter what computer/phone we are currently using.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently the 3 most popular cloud storage systems are Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox. So if all of them do the same thing, natural question to ask is: Can we unite them under the same thing?
        </p>
        <p>
            Our high-level goals are to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Let every user logged into our app store his personal files in the cloud by fragmenting files and uploading them to the cloud</li>
            <li>Be fully funcitioning on modern Web browsers.</li>
            <li>
                Provide every user with the opportunity to link his Stol account to all of the 3 services mentioned above.
            </li>
            <li>Provide fast download, upload and delete methods for the user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The project was divided, as is the case with most web projects, into two main parts: backend and frontend.
        </p>
        <section id="frontend">
            <!-- review? -->
            <h3>Frontend</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was understanding how web technologies work to their very root. Thus, for the frontend development of this project we relied solely on HTML JavaScript and CSS without the help of any frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We chose to rely on the solution of client side rendering. Using AJAX and the FETCH to call the REST API provided by the server (to be detailed in the next section), we used the information we received in JSON format to fill the page with user specific
                information such as username, the files available, occupied space, or the added accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application consists of 4 main pages:
                <ul>
                    <li>About Page - a small introduction to the project</li>
                    <li>Login Page - available to login available users and register new ones</li>
                    <li>Home Page - a page where you can view your available space, available files, as well as upload new files</li>
                    <li>Account Page - a page where you can view your available linked cloud storage accounts, as well as link to new accounts</li>
                </ul>
                All of these pages are detalied in the User Guide attached to this project, that we encourage you to read in order to better understand how this app should be used by everyday users.
            </p>
            <p>
                To support different resolutions, the frontend neded to be responsive and adapt to all sorts of possible sizes. For this, we relied on changing the CSS styling of elements depending on different resolutions of the screen, and also on the flexbox property,
                which allows developers to easily create responsive designs as objects automatically adapt themselves inside the flex containers.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="backend">
            <!-- review? -->
            <h3>Backend</h3>
            <p>
                The server-side of this project was written in node.js. The decision was made as we considered the learning curve would be smaller if we use JavaScript both on the fronntend and on the backend.
            </p>
            <section id="routing">
                <h4>Routing</h4>
                <p>
                    For the routing we went with a very simple, but efficient logic that would be useful for the development process. We established that any path that begins with one of the paths code>/api
                    </code>, <code>/auth</code> or <code>/admin</code> would be served by a special controller function. If not, then we would treat it as a static file and we would try to search for it in the <code>/view</code> view path. This meant
                    that adding a bunch of stylesheets, images or frontend scripts would be as easy as putting them into the right folder as the server would know automatically how to serve them instead of writing a specific function for serving every
                    single file requested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the REST routes, we also used, in some cases, dynamic routes, for example <code>/constant-route/{dynamic-part}</code>. For simplicity of code and implementation, established that the dynamic part of the route would only come in
                    on last position so that we could easily extract it's value.
                </p>
                <p>It is also worth noting the node.js included libraries allowed us to easily parse other request information (method, query parameters, request body, etc.).
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="database">
                <h4>Database Connection</h4>
                <p>
                    For the database, we went with MongoDB to store our information. This is because it allows a beautiful integration with node.js since it everything is provided/inserted in JSON format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used 3 main collections:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The users collection: stores all profile related information about the user</li>
                        <li>The files collection: stores all information regading a file belonging to one of the users</li>
                        <li>The file parts collection: stores information about every single part of the files that were divided upon uploading them, as well as information as to how to retreive them.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="login">
                <h4>Logging the user in</h4>
                <p>For the login module we provided the following mehods in the API:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code> POST /api/create-user </code>
                        <p>
                            Upon calling this request with a body constaining an email address, a username and a password as JSON, the server will check for previously exisiting users containing the same data, and creates the user, storing SHA256 hash over the password for security
                            reasons.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>POST /api/login</code>
                        <p>
                            Upon calling this request with either the username or the email address and the password, if successful, it return in the JSON response a JSON containing a JWT token. This token has an availalbility of 2 hours and can be passed in the <code>Authorization</code>                            header in order to access endpoints that require the user to be logged in.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="oauth">
                <h4>Adding cloud storage account</h4>
                <p>Once the user is logged in, one of the most important things he can do is add acounts make available space and start storing files. This is done by using the OAuth 2.0 workflow: the user chooses to add an account on the frontend, the frontend
                    requests Authorization from the required service. The service the shows its own login flow, afterwards asking the user the permision to store files in a dedicated app folder. After the user agrees, the service makes a request to the
                    Stol server containing a short lived code as query parameter which cand then be used to retreive the access tokens required to access that service. The tokens are stored in the users collection in the database so that they can be there
                    reused for future use.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="files">
                <h4>Handling the file uploads and downloads</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the main functionality of the app, thus many implementation ideas came to mind, but below are the ones we chose:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>POST /api/create-file</code>
                        <p>
                            This request sends the in the body some metadata regarding the file. Upon receiving the data, the server creates the file resource with the flag "created" set to false, associates it with the calling user (based on the token) and then, if successful,
                            returns a <code>fileId</code> in the response, which can then be used in the next endpoint to upload the file.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>POST /api/upload-file/fileId</code>
                        <p>
                            Using the fileId received in the prevoius request, we call this path with the desired file as the body content. The server then first checks if there is enough space available on all the drives by comparing it to the
                            <code>Content-Length</code> header. Then, we pre-calculate what the size of the next part to upload will be (the minimum between 5MB and the available space on the current drive to upload), Then as we process each chunk of
                            data that arrives to the server (it is a read stream, so the entire file does not arrive at once, but in chunks ok 16kb) we either add it to the buffer,if the buffer is not full, or we create a new buffer with precalculated
                            size, and we trigger an asyncronous downlooad. This process is repeated until all file parts have been uploaded to the server. For integrity check, we store a md5 hash for each file part. Afterwards, we mark the file as "created":true.
                            Our method is extremely fast beacuse we send each download asyncronously, and due to safely processing all chunks in order due to event emmitting in node.js, we are able to process big files wihout having to store them enirely
                            in the heap at once, nor do we have to write them in a temporary folder, so the file is processed in the least amount of time.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>GET /api/download-file/fileId</code>
                        <p>We can use the same fileId to download the file. The server will asyncronously request all the file parts and using events it wil make sure that tey are written in order in the response. Thus, we are downloading multiple chunks
                            at the same time, increasing our download speed singificantly rather than processing requests part by part and waiting for each to end before triggering the next.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>DELETE /api/delete-file/fileId</code>
                        <p>
                            This method deletes the file by requesting delete on all the file parts of the requested file. Same as the two methods above, the requests are sent asyncronously which again, means it takes very little time for the file to be deleted. Finally, we remove
                            all of the entries about it in the database.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h4>The Administrator API</h4>
                This module is responsible for administrating the database. We considered that an admin should: be able to grant other users admin privileges, revoke admin privileges from other users, view user information about quota, number of files, (but should not
                be able to view the content of the files), and to delete a user. All of this is possible through a simple flag in the database that identifies a user as admin. The API is as folows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>GET /admin/get-users</code>
                        <p>Iterates through all the users and retreives basic information about them in JSON format.</p>

                        <code>PUT /admin/grant-admin/userId, /admin/revoke-admin/userId</code>
                        <p>Grants/Revokes admin privileges from the user with the specified <code>userId</code></p>

                    <li>
                        <code>DELETE /admin/delete-user/userId</code>
                        <p>Deletes a user with the specified id: removes all of his data, including deleting all of his files.</p>

            <h3>Development Stages</h3>
            <p>As mentioned previously, we used client-side rendering. That meant in the first part we focused on getting the REST API an its feet and the we united that with the frontend. However, due to the nature of the OAuth 2.0 workflow, some steps
                required mandatory frontend implementations. In the end, it al went up smoothly, as the backend was mostly written by Anghel Florin-Mihai and the frontend by Asăndoaiei David, with both being able to swap roles depending on the status
                of the project.
